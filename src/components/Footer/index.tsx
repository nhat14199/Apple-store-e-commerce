            * Monthly pricing is available when you select Apple Card Monthly
            Installments (ACMI) as payment type at checkout at Apple, and is
            subject to credit approval and credit limit. Financing terms vary by
            product. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI and are subject
            to your card’s variable APR. See the Apple Card Customer
            Agreement(Opens in a new window) for more information. ACMI is not
            available for purchases made online at special storefronts. The last
            month’s payment for each product will be the product's purchase
            price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI
            financing is subject to change at any time for any reason, including
            but not limited to, installment term lengths and eligible products.
            See https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211204(Opens in a new window) for

            1. Trade-in values will vary based on the condition, year, and
            configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are
            eligible for credit. You must be at least 18 years old to be
            eligible to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in
            value may be applied toward a qualifying new device purchase, or
            added to an Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on
            receipt of a qualifying device matching the description provided
            when estimate was made. Sales tax may be assessed on full value of a
            new device purchase. In-store trade-in requires presentation of a
            valid photo ID (local law may require saving this information).
            Offer may not be available in all stores, and may vary between
            in-store and online trade-in. Some stores may have additional
            requirements. Apple or its trade-in partners reserve the right to
            refuse or limit quantity of any trade-in transaction for any reason.
            More details are available from Apple’s trade-in partner for
            trade-in and recycling of eligible devices. Restrictions and
            limitations may apply.

            2. Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option
            that is only available if you select it at checkout in the U.S. for
            eligible Apple products purchased at Apple Store locations,
            apple.com(Opens in a new window), the Apple Store app, or by calling
            1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit.
            See https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211204(Opens in a new window) for
            more information about eligible products. APR ranges may vary based
            on when you accepted an Apple Card. Cardholders who accept an Apple
            Card on and/or after August 10, 2023: variable APRs for Apple Card,
            other than ACMI, range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on
            creditworthiness. Rates as of August 10, 2023. Existing cardholders:
            see your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee. If you buy
            an ACMI eligible product by choosing to pay in full with Apple Card
            (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the Apple Card
            variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are
            subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. You’ll need to select AT&T,
            T-Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you check out. An iPhone
            purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers
            at any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the
            following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan;
            participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work
            for small businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase
            Programs, or on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for
            each product will be the product's purchase price, less all other
            payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to
            change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to,
            installment term lengths and eligible products. See
            https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211204(Opens in a new window) for
            information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing. See the Apple
            Card Customer Agreement(Opens in a new window) for more information
            about ACMI financing.
